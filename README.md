# simple-lamp-vagrantbox

This is the configuration for a simple LAMP stack vagrant box, based on [ubuntu/xenial64](https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/xenial64)

The provisioning file was inspired by this [one](https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/vagrant-base-config/blob/master/provision/setup.sh).

I made this because Docker on Windows 10 kind of sucks for not letting me use Genymotion with VirtualBox (****ing Hyper-V screws everything).

Anyways, feel free to check it out, add things, try to optimize, etc. I'm not a dev-ops guy, just an Android/Web developer trying to set up a nice environment.

Cheers!
